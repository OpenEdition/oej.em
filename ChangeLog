OpenEdition Journals Editorial Model - ChangeLog

##1.0.3

The major development in this new version involves the addition of an IdRef field to the person index class (entities_auteurs). This addition is made upon activation of the IdRef plugin for Lodel 1 (https://github.com/OpenEdition/idref-plugin). This plugin allows querying the IdRef database to link authors of editorial units to their IdRef identifier.

Removals

Several removals have been made in this release:
Collection index and associated fields: this index was used for journal sites that had changed their ISSN. We have organized the division of these sites and removed the index.
Advanced license index and associated fields: as part of the implementation of the new General Terms and Conditions of Use (hereinafter "GTCU"), all OpenEdition Journals sites now have a default license defined in a shared index. The advanced license index is therefore no longer used at the site level.
Less used publication types: removal of certain publication types on the platform to harmonize the editorial model.
